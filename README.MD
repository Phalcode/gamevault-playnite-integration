# GameVault Playnite Integration

This Playnite extension allows you to integrate GameVault with Playnite using [GameVault+](https://gamevau.lt/gamevault-plus)â€™s exclusive CLI and URI interface. It won't work if you are not subscribed to [GameVault+](https://gamevau.lt/gamevault-plus).

## Usage

1. [Set Up GameVault Plus in your GameVault Client](https://gamevau.lt/docs/gamevault-plus/introduction#get-started).
2. Install the latest version of this extension using Playnite's Addon Browser or by adding the `.pext` file from the Releases.
3. Configure the integration in Playnite:
   - Go to `Library -> Configure Integrations... -> GameVault`.
   - Enter your GameVault server URL (include `http://` or `https://`).
   - Enter your GameVault user credentials.
4. To sync your library, select `Update Game Library -> GameVault`.
